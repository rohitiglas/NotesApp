<h3>react-testing-library</h1>
<p>React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components.

Projects created with Create React App have out of the box support for React Testing Library. If that is not the case, you can add it via npm like so:
  <h4>npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react </h4>
  
  The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:

The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
